# 🛩️ Paper Plane Adventures – A Two Player Game Between Desktop and Mobile

A two-player game where one person plays on desktop and the other on mobile. Work together or compete by flying paper airplanes through hoops.

## Overview

This project was created as part of a two-week assignment for a third-year design studio course, where we explored networked multiplayer experiences using the [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) framework.

I was inspired by the game [Lifeslide](https://store.steampowered.com/app/956140/Lifeslide/) and wanted to make a simple flying game based on paper airplanes.

There are two modes:

- **Collaborative Mode**
  - Players share one airplane.
  - Mobile player tilts phone to move up and down.
  - Desktop player clicks buttons to move left and right.
  - The goal is to pass through hoops together.

- **Competitive Mode**
  - Each player controls their own airplane.
  - Mobile player is limited to up and down movement.
  - Desktop player is limited to left and right movement.
  - Ghost planes and hoops show the opponent’s position.
  - The goal is to score more points than the other player.

### Supported Devices

This experience requires two players, one on mobile and one on desktop.

## 🧾Setup Instructions

This project is not hosted online at the moment. To try it out locally:

1. Download and unzip [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/downloads/windows?tab=download) and create a free account
2. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
3. Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)  
4. Open your terminal and run the following commands to clone the repository and navigate to it:
   - `git clone https://github.com/acce8711/Assignment3-IMD3901B.git`
   - `cd paper-plane-duo`
5. Run the following commands in the same terminal to start the server:
   - `npm install`
   - `node app.js`
6. Set up ngrok connection:
   - Navigate to the folder where you unzipped Ngrok from step 1
   - Open a new terminal in the folder
   - run `./ngrok.exe config add-authtoken {your Authtoken}` (Your authoken should be visible on the Ngrok web dashboard under Getting started --> Setup & Instillation)

6. Open the link that is generated by the above ngrok command on a **phone**
7. You're all set! Choose a mode and follow the instructions on screen

## 🚧 What Was Challenging

The hardest part was running into frame rate differences. My phone and computer both run at 60fps, so syncing looked fine. But when I tested it with a classmate’s 120fps device, their airplane moved too fast. To fix this, I looked at A-Frame’s source code and how they use the `tick()` function in the `wasd-controls` component. I realzied I could scale movement using the built-in `deltaTime` value. After implementing that, movement synced properly across devices with different frame rates.

## ✅ What Went Well

I'm happy with how the ghost plane and ghost hoops turned out in competitive mode. They were extra features I wasn’t sure I’d have time to finish, but I managed to get them working and I think they help show the other player's position in a clear and non-intrusive way.
